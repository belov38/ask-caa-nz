(5)   A person detained under subsection (4) must be delivered to a constable as soon as practicable.

(2)   The refusal of a person to consent to the searching of the person, or any thing in the person’s possession, does not of itself constitute reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence against the Aviation Crimes Act 1972 has been, is being, or will be, committed. (3)   A constable may, without a warrant,— (a)   search the person, and any thing in the person’s possession; and (b)   detain the person for the purposes of the search; and (c)   take possession of any item or substance found in the course of the search that is specified in section 11(1) of the Aviation Crimes Act 1972.

(2)   If any question arises as to whether an actual carrier has authority from a contracting carrier to perform any carriage, that authority is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to be presumed.  Compare: 1990 No 98 s 91U  270   Application of this subpart  (1)   This subpart applies to any carriage by air (other than international carriage described in subsection (3)) in which, according to the contract between the parties,— (a)   the place of departure and the place of destination are both in New Zealand; and (b)   there is no agreed stopping place outside New Zealand. (2)   Subsection (1) applies even if the aircraft in which the carriage takes place is at the same time engaged in the international carriage described in subsection (3). (3)   The international carriage referred to in subsections (1) and (2) is carriage in which, according to the contract between the parties, the place of departure and  Part 8 s 270   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 172

(3)   This section does not limit or affect the liability of a carrier under any other enactment or rule of law.  Compare: 1990 No 98 s 91Z  275   Provisions if carriage performed by successive carriers  If carriage is performed or is to be performed by successive carriers, the contracting carrier who is liable is the successive carrier who performed or was to perform the carriage where the delay occurred.  Compare: 1990 No 98 s 91Y  276   Avoidance of liability  The carrier is not liable under this subpart if the carrier proves that— (a)   the carrier, or the carrier’s servants or agents, took all necessary meas‐ ures to avoid the damage; or (b)   it was not possible for the carrier, or the carrier’s servants or agents, to take those measures.  Compare: 1990 No 98 s 91ZA  277   Limitation of liability  (1)   The liability of the carrier in respect of damage caused by delay is limited to the lesser of— (a)   the amount of damage proved to have been sustained as a result of the delay; and (b)   an amount representing 10 times the sum paid for the carriage. (2)   Despite subsection (1), the carrier may, by special contract, increase the amount of the carrier’s liability under that subsection.

278   Contracting out  (1)   The provisions of this subpart have effect despite anything to the contrary in any contract or in any bylaws made by a carrier purporting to relieve the carrier of liability. (2)   A provision of a contract of carriage or any bylaw that has the effect of overriding or limiting a carrier’s liability under this subpart (whether directly or indirectly) is unenforceable. (3)   Subsections (1) and (2) are subject to subsection (4). (4)   Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) applies in respect of a provision that— (a)   imposes a stricter duty on the carrier than would be imposed under this subpart; or (b)   provides a more advantageous remedy against the carrier than would be provided under this subpart.

(2)   Without limiting subsection (1), the court may, if the liability is, or may be, enforceable in other proceedings in New Zealand or elsewhere,— (a)   award an amount less than the court would have awarded if the limita‐ tion applied solely to the proceedings before the court; or (b)   make any part of its award conditional on the result of any other pro‐ ceedings.

(2)   Person A must not bring proceedings referred to in subsection (1) to obtain a contribution from person B later than 2 years after the time when judgment is obtained against person A.

(2)   Despite subsection (1), application may be made to the court, after giving notice to the intended defendant, for leave to bring an action at any time within 6 years after the date on which the cause of action accrued as provided in subsection (1). (3)   On application under subsection (2), the court may grant leave accordingly if it considers that it is just to do so and if it considers that— (a)   the delay in bringing the action was caused by— (i)   mistake of fact; or (ii)   mistake of any matter of law other than the provisions of this subsection; or (iii)   any other reasonable cause; or (b)   the intended defendant was not materially prejudiced in the defendant’s defence or otherwise by the delay.

Schedule 4 The Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol of 1955 and the Montreal Additional Protocols Nos 1 and 2 and Protocol No 4 of 1975  s 254  Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air Chapter I Scope—Definitions  Article 1  1.   This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking. 2.   For the purposes of this Convention, the expression   international carriage  means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a single High Con‐ tracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention. 3.   Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed, for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.  Article 2  1.   This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1. 2.   In the carriage of postal items the carrier shall be liable only to the relevant postal administration in accordance with the rules applicable to the relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 4 303

3.   Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this Con‐ vention shall not apply to the carriage of postal items.  Chapter II Documents of carriage  Section 1—Passenger ticket  Article 3  1.   In respect of the carriage of passengers a ticket shall be delivered containing: a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; c)   a notice to the effect that, if the passenger’s journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage to baggage. 2.   The passenger ticket shall constitute   prima facie   evidence of the conclusion and conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the passenger ticket does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the carrier, the passenger embarks without a passenger ticket having been delivered, or if the ticket does not include the notice required by paragraph 1 c) of this Article, the carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22.  Section 2—Baggage check  Article 4  1.   In respect of the carriage of registered baggage, a baggage check shall be delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1, shall contain: a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; c)   a notice to the effect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw  Schedule 4   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 304

Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss of or damage to baggage. 2.   The baggage check shall constitute   prima facie   evidence of the registration of the baggage and of the conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier takes charge of the baggage without a baggage check having been delivered or if the baggage check (unless combined with or incorporated in the passenger ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 1 c)) does not include the notice required by paragraph 1 c) of this Article, he shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22, paragraph 2.  Section III—Documentation relating to cargo  Article 5  1.   In respect of the carriage of cargo an air waybill shall be delivered. 2.   Any other means which would preserve a record of the carriage to be per‐ formed may, with the consent of the consignor, be substituted for the delivery of an air waybill. If such other means are used, the carrier shall, if so requested by the consignor, deliver to the consignor a receipt for the cargo permitting identification of the consignment and access to the information contained in the record preserved by such other means. 3.   The impossibility of using, at points of transit and destination, the other means which would preserve the record of the carriage referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article does not entitle the carrier to refuse to accept the cargo for carriage.  Article 6  1.   The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts. 2.   The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”; it shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the consignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier. The third part shall be signed by the carrier and handed by him to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted. 3.   The signature of the carrier and that of the consignor may be printed or stamped. 4.   If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, he shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor.  Article 7  When there is more than one package:  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 4 305

a)   the carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills; b)   the consignor has the right to require the carrier to deliver separate receipts when the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 5 are used.  Article 8  The air waybill and the receipt for the cargo shall contain: a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; and c)   an indication of the weight of the consignment.  Article 9  Non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 5 to 8 shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability.  Article 10  1.   The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and state‐ ments relating to the cargo inserted by him or on his behalf in the air waybill or furnished by him or on his behalf to the carrier for insertion in the receipt for the cargo or for insertion in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 5. 2.   The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suffered by him, or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the irregular‐ ity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements furnished by the consignor or on his behalf. 3.   Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the carrier shall indemnify the consignor against all damage suffered by him, or by any other person to whom the consignor is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrect‐ ness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements inserted by the carrier or on his behalf in the receipt for the cargo or in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 5.  Article 11  1.   The air waybill or the receipt for the cargo is   prima facie   evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the acceptance of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage mentioned therein. 2.   Any statements in the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo relating to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are   prima facie   evidence of the facts stated; those relating  Schedule 4   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 306

to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.  Article 12  1.   Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the airport of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee originally designated, or by requiring it to be returned to the airport of departure. He must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and he must repay any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right. 2.   If it is impossible to carry out the orders of the consignor the carrier must so inform him forthwith. 3.   If the carrier obeys the orders of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo delivered to the latter, he will be liable, without prejudice to his right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo. 4.   The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13. Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated with, the con‐ signor resumes his right of disposition.  Article 13  1.   Except when the consignor has exercised his right under Article 12, the con‐ signee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage. 2.   Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives. 3.   If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.  Article 14  The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his own name, whether he is acting in his own interest or  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 4 307

in the interest of another, provided that he carries out the obligations imposed by the contract of carriage.  Article 15  1.   Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor and the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee. 2.   The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express provi‐ sion in the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo.  Article 16  1.   The consignor must furnish such information and such documents as are neces‐ sary to meet the formalities of customs, octroi or police before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier, his servants or agents. 2.   The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents.  Chapter III Liability of the carrier  Article 17  The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.  Article 18  1.   The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, any registered baggage, if the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. 2.   The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the occurrence which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. 3.   However, the carrier is not liable if he proves that the destruction, loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted solely from one or more of the following: a)   inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo; b)   defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or his servants or agents;  Schedule 4   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 308

c)   an act of war or an armed conflict; d)   an act of public authority carried out in connexion with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo. 4.   The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding paragraphs of this Article comprises the period during which the baggage or cargo is in the charge of the carrier, whether in an airport or on board an aircraft, or, in the case of a landing outside an airport, in any place whatsoever. 5.   The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by river performed outside an airport. If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air.  Article 19  The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passen‐ gers, baggage or cargo.  Article 20  In the carriage of passengers and baggage, and in the case of damage occasioned by delay in the carriage of cargo, the carrier shall not be liable if he proves that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for them to take such measures.  Article 21  1.   In the carriage of passengers and baggage, if the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the person suffering the damage the Court may, in accordance with the provisions of its own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability. 2.   In the carriage of cargo, if the carrier proves that the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he derives his rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from his liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage.  Article 22 (as it reads where Additional Protocol No. 1 applies)  1.   In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to the sum of 8 300 Special Drawing Rights. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodic payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments shall not exceed this limit. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 4 309

2.   In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination. 3.   As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to 332 Special Drawing Rights per passenger. 4.   The sums mentioned in terms of the Special Drawing Right in this Article shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgment. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgment, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that High Contracting Party. Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monet‐ ary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 22 may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier in judicial proceedings in their territories is fixed at a sum of 125 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 of Article 22; 250 monetary units per kilogramme with respect to paragraph 2 of Article 22; and 5 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 3 of Article 22. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.  Article 22 (as it reads where Additional Protocol No. 2 applies but not Protocol No. 4)  1.   In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to the sum of 16 600 Special Drawing Rights. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the form of periodic payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments  Schedule 4   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 310

shall not exceed this limit. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability. 2. a) In the carriage of registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the passenger’s or consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination. b)   In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered baggage or cargo or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability. 3.   As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to 332 Special Drawing Rights per passenger. 4.   The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later. 5.   The sums mentioned in terms of the Special Drawing Right in this Article shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgment. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgment, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that High Contracting Party.

same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability. 3.   As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability of the carrier is limited to 332 Special Drawing Rights per passenger. 4.   The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damage awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later. 5.   The sums mentioned in terms of the Special Drawing Right in this Article shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgment.

Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention. 2.   Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried.  Article 24  1.

In the carriage of cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits of liability set out in this Conven‐ tion without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. Such limits of liability constitute maximum limits and may not be exceeded whatever the circumstances which gave rise to the liability.  Schedule 4   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 314

Article 25  In the carriage of passengers and baggage, the limits of liability specified in Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that he was acting within the scope of his employment.  Article 25A  1.   If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which this Convention relates, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which that carrier himself is entitled to invoke under Article 22. 2.   The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, his servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits. 3.   In the carriage of passengers and baggage, the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.

In the case of delay the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his disposal. 3.   Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage or by separate notice in writing, despatched within the times aforesaid. 4.   Failing complaint within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on his part.  Article 27  In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his estate.

Article 28  1.   An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the court having jurisdiction where the carrier is ordinarily resident, or has his principal place of business, or has an establishment by which the contract has been made or before the court having jurisdiction at the place of destination. 2.   Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the court seised of the case.  Article 29  1.   The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped. 2.   The method of calculating the period of limitation shall be determined by the law of the court seised of the case.  Article 30  1.   In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive carriers and falling within the definition set-out in the third paragraph of Article 1, each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subjected to the rules set out in this Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under his supervision. 2.   In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agree‐ ment, the first carrier assumed liability for the whole journey. 3.   As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.  Article 30A  Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.

In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1. 2.   Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the parties in the case of combined carriage from inserting in the document of air carriage conditions relating to other modes of carriage, provided that the provisions of this Convention are observed as regards the carriage by air.  Chapter V General and final provisions  Article 32  Any clause contained in the contract and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void. Nevertheless for the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject to this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place within one of the jurisdictions referred to in the first paragraph of Article 28.  Article 33  Except as provided in paragraph 3 of Article 5, nothing in this Convention shall prevent the carrier either from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, or from making regulations which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention.  Article 34  The provisions of Articles 3 to 8 inclusive relating to documents of carriage shall not apply in the case of carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of an air carrier’s business.

Schedule 5 The Guadalajara Convention  s 254  Part 1  The English Text Convention, Supplementary to the Warsaw Convention, for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air Performed by a Person Other Than the Contracting Carrier. The States signatory to the present Convention  NOTING that the Warsaw Convention does not contain particular rules relating to international carriage by air performed by a person who is not a party to the agree‐ ment for carriage CONSIDERING that it is therefore desirable to formulate rules to apply in such circumstances HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:  Article I  In this Convention: (a)   “Warsaw Convention” means the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929, or the Warsaw Convention as amended at The Hague, 1955, according to whether the carriage under the agreement referred to in paragraph (b) is governed by the one or by the other; (b)   “contracting carrier” means a person who as a principal makes an agreement for carriage governed by the Warsaw Convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger or consignor; (c)   “actual carrier” means a person, other than the contracting carrier, who, by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, performs the whole or part of the carriage contemplated in paragraph (b) but who is not with respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of the Warsaw Convention. Such authority is presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.  Article II  If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the agreement referred to in Article I, paragraph (b), is governed by the Warsaw Conven‐ tion, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise  Schedule 5   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 332

provided in this Convention, be subject to the rules of the Warsaw Convention, the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the agreement, the latter solely for the carriage which he performs.  Article III  1.   The acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the contracting carrier. 2.   The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the actual carrier. Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability exceeding the limits specified in Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention. Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not imposed by the Warsaw Convention or any waiver of rights conferred by that Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination contemplated in Article 22 of the said Convention, shall not affect the actual carrier unless agreed to by him.  Article IV  Any complaint to be made or order to be given under the Warsaw Convention to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the actual carrier. Nevertheless, orders referred to in Article 12 of the Warsaw Convention shall only be effective if addressed to the contracting carrier.  Article V  In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, be entitled to avail himself of the limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent he is unless it is proved that he acted in a manner which, under the Warsaw Convention, prevents the limits of liability from being invoked.  Article VI  In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to him.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 5 333

Article VII  In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately. If the action is brought against only one of those carriers, that carrier shall have the right to require the other carrier to be joined in the proceedings, the procedure and effects being governed by the law of the court seised of the case.  Article VIII  Any action for damages contemplated in Article VII of this Convention must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, either before a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier, as provided in Article 28 of the Warsaw Convention, or before the court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier is ordinarily resident or has his principal place of business.  Article IX  1.   Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the actual carrier of liability under this Convention or to fix a lower limit than that which is applicable according to this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole agreement, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention. 2.   In respect of the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the preceding para‐ graph shall not apply to contractual provisions governing loss or damage resulting from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the cargo carried. 3.   Any clause contained in an agreement for carriage and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void. Nevertheless, for the carriage of cargo arbitration clauses are allowed, subject to this Convention, if the arbitration is to take place in one of the jurisdictions referred to in Article VIII.  Article X  Except as provided in Article VII, nothing in this Convention shall affect the rights and obligations of the two carriers between themselves.  Article XI  Until the date on which this Convention comes into force in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII, it shall remain open for signature on behalf of any State which at that date is a Member of the United Nations or of any of the Specialised Agencies.

Schedule 6 The Montreal Convention  s 414  The English Text Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules For International Carriage by Air  The States Parties To This Convention RECOGNIZING the significant contribution of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed in Warsaw on 12 October 1929, hereinafter referred to as the “Warsaw Convention”, and other related instruments to the harmonization of private international air law; RECOGNIZING the need to modernize and consolidate the Warsaw Convention and related instruments; RECOGNIZING the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of consumers in international carriage by air and the need for equitable compensation based on the principle of restitution; REAFFIRMING the desirability of an orderly development of international air trans‐ port operations and the smooth flow of passengers, baggage and cargo in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on 7 December 1944; CONVINCED that collective State action for further harmonization and codification of certain rules governing international carriage by air through a new Convention is the most adequate means of achieving an equitable balance of interests; HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:  Chapter I General provisions  Article 1—Scope of application  1.   This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking. 2.   For the purposes of this Convention, the expression   international carriage  means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be a break in the carriage or a transhipment, are situated either within the territories of two States Parties, or within the territory of a single State Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even if that State is not a State Party. Carriage between two points within the territory of a single  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 337

State Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention. 3.   Carriage to be performed by several successive carriers is deemed, for the pur‐ poses of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State. 4.   This Convention applies also to carriage as set out in Chapter V, subject to the terms contained therein.  Article 2—Carriage performed by State and carriage of postal items  1.   This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1. 2.   In the carriage of postal items, the carrier shall be liable only to the relevant postal administration in accordance with the rules applicable to the relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations. 3.   Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this Con‐ vention shall not apply to the carriage of postal items.  Chapter II Documentation and duties of the parties relating to the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo  Article 3—Passengers and baggage  1.   In respect of carriage of passengers, an individual or collective document of carriage shall be delivered containing: (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single State Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place. 2.   Any other means which preserves the information indicated in paragraph 1 may be substituted for the delivery of the document referred to in that para‐ graph. If any such other means is used, the carrier shall offer to deliver to the passenger a written statement of the information so preserved. 3.   The carrier shall deliver to the passenger a baggage identification tag for each piece of checked baggage. 4.   The passenger shall be given written notice to the effect that where this Con‐ vention is applicable it governs and may limit the liability of carriers in respect  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 338

of death or injury and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay. 5.   Non-compliance with the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, nonetheless, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability.  Article 4—Cargo  1.   In respect of the carriage of cargo, an air waybill shall be delivered. 2.   Any other means which preserves a record of the carriage to be performed may be substituted for the delivery of an air waybill. If such other means are used, the carrier shall, if so requested by the consignor, deliver to the consignor a cargo receipt permitting identification of the consignment and access to the information contained in the record preserved by such other means.  Article 5—Contents of air waybill or cargo receipt  The air waybill or the cargo receipt shall include: (a)   an indication of the places of departure and destination; (b)   if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single State Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; and (c)   an indication of the weight of the consignment.  Article 6—Document relating to the nature of the cargo  The consignor may be required, if necessary, to meet the formalities of customs, police and similar public authorities to deliver a document indicating the nature of the cargo. This provision creates for the carrier no duty, obligation or liability resulting therefrom.  Article 7—Description of air waybill  1.   The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts. 2.   The first part shall be marked “for the carrier”; it shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be marked “for the consignee”; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier. The third part shall be signed by the carrier who shall hand it to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted. 3.   The signature of the carrier and that of the consignor may be printed or stamped. 4.   If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, the carrier shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 339

Article 8—Documentation for multiple packages  When there is more than one package: (a)   the carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills; (b)   the consignor has the right to require the carrier to deliver separate cargo receipts when the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4 are used.  Article 9—Non-compliance with documentary requirements  Non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 4 to 8 shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, nonetheless, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability.  Article 10—Responsibility for particulars of documentation  1.   The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and state‐ ments relating to the cargo inserted by it or on its behalf in the air waybill or furnished by it or on its behalf to the carrier for insertion in the cargo receipt or for insertion in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4. The foregoing shall also apply where the person acting on behalf of the consignor is also the agent of the carrier. 2.   The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suffered by it, or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements furnished by the consignor or on its behalf. 3.   Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the carrier shall indemnify the consignor against all damage suffered by it, or by any other person to whom the consignor is liable, by reason of the irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements inserted by the carrier or on its behalf in the cargo receipt or in the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4.  Article 11—Evidentiary value of documentation  1.   The air waybill or the cargo receipt is   prima facie   evidence of the conclusion of the contract, of the acceptance of the cargo and of the conditions of carriage mentioned therein. 2.   Any statements in the air waybill or the cargo receipt relating to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the number of packages, are   prima facie   evidence of the facts stated; those relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the air waybill or the cargo receipt to have been, checked by it in the presence of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 340

Article 12—Right of disposition of cargo  1.   Subject to its liability to carry out all its obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the airport of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee originally designated, or by requiring it to be returned to the airport of departure. The consignor must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and must reimburse any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right. 2.   If it is impossible to carry out the instructions of the consignor, the carrier must so inform the consignor forthwith. 3.   If the carrier carries out the instructions of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt delivered to the latter, the carrier will be liable, without prejudice to its right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt. 4.   The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13. Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the cargo, or cannot be communicated with, the consignor resumes its right of disposition.  Article 13—Delivery of the cargo  1.   Except when the consignor has exercised its right under Article 12, the con‐ signee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to require the carrier to deliver the cargo to it, on payment of the charges due and on complying with the conditions of carriage. 2.   Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives. 3.   If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.  Article 14—Enforcement of the rights of consignor and consignee  The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given to them by Articles 12 and 13, each in its own name, whether it is acting in its own interest or in the interest of another, provided that it carries out the obligations imposed by the contract of carriage.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 341

Article 15—Relations of consignor and consignee or mutual relations of third parties  1.   Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor and the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee. 2.   The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express provi‐ sion in the air waybill or the cargo receipt.  Article 16—Formalities of Customs, Police or other public authorities  1.   The consignor must furnish such information and such documents as are neces‐ sary to meet the formalities of customs, police and any other public authorities before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier, its servants or agents. 2.   The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the correctness or sufficiency of such information or documents.  Chapter III Liability of the carrier and extent of compensation for damage  Article 17—Death and injury of passengers—Damage to baggage  1.   The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of death or bodily injury of a passenger upon condition only that the accident which caused the death or injury took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking. 2.   The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of destruction or loss of, or of damage to, checked baggage upon condition only that the event which caused the destruction, loss or damage took place on board the aircraft or during any period within which the checked baggage was in the charge of the carrier. However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage. In the case of unchecked baggage, including personal items, the carrier is liable if the damage resulted from its fault or that of its servants or agents. 3.   If the carrier admits the loss of the checked baggage, or if the checked baggage has not arrived at the expiration of twenty-one days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the passenger is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage. 4.   Unless otherwise specified, in this Convention the term “baggage” means both checked baggage and unchecked baggage.  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 342

Article 18—Damage to cargo  1.   The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the event which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. 2.   However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent it proves that the destruc‐ tion, or loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted from one or more of the following: (a)   inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo; (b)   defective packaging of that cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or its servants or agents; (c)   an act of war or an armed conflict; (d)   an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo. 3.   The carriage by air within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article comprises the period during which the cargo is in the charge of the carrier. 4.   The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land, by sea or by inland waterway performed outside an airport. If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air. If a carrier, without the consent of the consignor, substitutes carriage by another mode of transport for the whole or part of a carriage intended by the agreement between the parties to be carriage by air, such carriage by another mode of transport is deemed to be within the period of carriage by air.  Article 19—Delay  The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of pas‐ sengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carrier shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures.  Article 20—Exoneration  If the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he or she derives his or her rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage. When by reason of death or injury of a passenger compensation is claimed by a person other than the passenger, the carrier shall likewise be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the extent that it proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 343

negligence or other wrongful act or omission of that passenger. This Article applies to all the liability provisions in the Convention, including paragraph 1 of Article 21.  Article 21—Compensation in case of death or injury of passengers  1.   For damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 not exceeding 151 880 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger, the carrier shall not be able to exclude or limit its liability. 2.   The carrier shall not be liable for damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 to the extent that they exceed for each passenger 151 880 Special Drawing Rights if the carrier proves that: (a)   such damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the carrier or its servants or agents; or (b)   such damage was solely due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a third party.  Schedule 6 Article 21 paragraph 1: amended, on 28 December 2024, by clause 6(a) of the Civil Aviation (Montreal Convention) Order 2024 (SL 2024/269). Schedule 6 Article 21 paragraph 2: amended, on 28 December 2024, by clause 6(b) of the Civil Aviation (Montreal Convention) Order 2024 (SL 2024/269).  Article 22—Limits of liability in relation to delay, baggage and cargo  1.   In the case of damage caused by delay as specified in Article 19 in the carriage of persons, the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to 6 303 Special Drawing Rights. 2.   In the carriage of baggage, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to 1 519 Special Drawing Rights for each pas‐ senger unless the passenger has made, at the time when the checked baggage was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the passenger’s actual interest in delivery at destination. 3.   In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to a sum of 26 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the consignor’s actual interest in delivery at destination. 4.   In the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay of part of the cargo, or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the amount to which the carrier’s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 344

the destruction, loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same air waybill, or the same receipt or, if they were not issued, by the same record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability. 5.   The foregoing provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier, its servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that such servant or agent was acting within the scope of its employment. 6.   The limits prescribed in Article 21 and in this Article shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff, including interest. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.  Schedule 6 Article 22 paragraph 1: amended, on 28 December 2024, by clause 6(c) of the Civil Aviation (Montreal Convention) Order 2024 (SL 2024/269). Schedule 6 Article 22 paragraph 2: amended, on 28 December 2024, by clause 6(d) of the Civil Aviation (Montreal Convention) Order 2024 (SL 2024/269). Schedule 6 Article 22 paragraph 3: amended, on 28 December 2024, by clause 6(e) of the Civil Aviation (Montreal Convention) Order 2024 (SL 2024/269).  Article 23—Conversion of Monetary Units  1.   The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Convention shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgement. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgement, for its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State. 2.   Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International Monet‐ ary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article may, at the time of ratification or accession or at any  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 345

time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier prescribed in Art‐ icle 21 is fixed at a sum of 1 500 000 monetary units per passenger in judicial proceedings in their territories; 62 500 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 1 of Article 22; 15 000 monetary units per passenger with respect to paragraph 2 of Article 22; and 250 monetary units per kilogramme with respect to paragraph 3 of Article 22. This monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures. The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned. 3.   The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this Article and the conversion method mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles 21 and 22 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1 of this Article. States Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2 of this Article as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.  Article 24—Review of Limits  1.   Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 25 of this Convention and sub‐ ject to paragraph 2 below, the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 21, 22 and 23 shall be reviewed by the Depositary at five-year intervals, the first such review to take place at the end of the fifth year following the date of entry into force of this Convention, or if the Convention does not enter into force within five years of the date it is first open for signature, within the first year of its entry into force, by reference to an inflation factor which corresponds to the accumulated rate of inflation since the previous revision or in the first instance since the date of entry into force of the Convention. The measure of the rate of inflation to be used in determining the inflation factor shall be the weighted average of the annual rates of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Indices of the States whose currencies comprise the Special Drawing Right mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 23. 2.   If the review referred to in the preceding paragraph concludes that the inflation factor has exceeded 10 per cent, the Depositary shall notify States Parties of a revision of the limits of liability. Any such revision shall become effective six months after its notification to the States Parties. If within three months after its notification to the States Parties a majority of the States Parties register their disapproval, the revision shall not become effective and the Depositary shall refer the matter to a meeting of the States Parties. The Depositary shall immediately notify all States Parties of the coming into force of any revision.  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 346

3.   Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the procedure referred to in para‐ graph 2 of this Article shall be applied at any time provided that one-third of the States Parties express a desire to that effect and upon condition that the inflation factor referred to in paragraph 1 has exceeded 30 per cent since the previous revision or since the date of entry into force of this Convention if there has been no previous revision. Subsequent reviews using the procedure described in paragraph 1 of this Article will take place at five-year intervals starting at the end of the fifth year following the date of the reviews under the present paragraph.  Article 25—Stipulation on limits  A carrier may stipulate that the contract of carriage shall be subject to higher limits of liability than those provided for in this Convention or to no limits of liability whatsoever.  Article 26—Invalidity of contractual provisions  Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.  Article 27—Freedom to contract  Nothing contained in this Convention shall prevent the carrier from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, from waiving any defences available under the Conven‐ tion, or from laying down conditions which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention.  Article 28—Advance payments  In the case of aircraft accidents resulting in death or injury of passengers, the carrier shall, if required by its national law, make advance payments without delay to a natural person or persons who are entitled to claim compensation in order to meet the immediate economic needs of such persons. Such advance payments shall not consti‐ tute a recognition of liability and may be offset against any amounts subsequently paid as damages by the carrier.  Article 29—Basis of claims  In the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. In any such action, punitive, exemplary or any other non-compensatory damages shall not be recoverable.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 347

Article 30—Servants, agents—Aggregation of claims  1.   If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier arising out of damage to which the Convention relates, such servant or agent, if they prove that they acted within the scope of their employment, shall be entitled to avail themselves of the conditions and limits of liability which the carrier itself is entitled to invoke under this Convention. 2.   The aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, its servants and agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits. 3.   Save in respect of the carriage of cargo, the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the servant or agent done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result.  Article 31—Timely notice of complaints  1.   Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of checked baggage or cargo without complaint is   prima facie   evidence that the same has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage or with the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 3 and paragraph 2 of Article 4. 2.   In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the car‐ rier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of checked baggage and fourteen days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo. In the case of delay, the complaint must be made at the latest within twenty-one days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his or her disposal. 3.   Every complaint must be made in writing and given or dispatched within the times aforesaid. 4.   If no complaint is made within the times aforesaid, no action shall lie against the carrier, save in the case of fraud on its part.  Article 32—Death of person liable  In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his or her estate.  Article 33—Jurisdiction  1.   An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of its principal place of business, or where it has a place of business through which the contract has been made or before the court at the place of destination. 2.   In respect of damage resulting from the death or injury of a passenger, an action may be brought before one of the courts mentioned in paragraph 1 of  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 348

this Article, or in the territory of a State Party in which at the time of the accident the passenger has his or her principal and permanent residence and to or from which the carrier operates services for the carriage of passengers by air, either on its own aircraft, or on another carrier’s aircraft pursuant to a commercial agreement, and in which that carrier conducts its business of carriage of passengers by air from premises leased or owned by the carrier itself or by another carrier with which it has a commercial agreement. 3.   For the purposes of paragraph 2, (a)   “commercial agreement” means an agreement, other than an agency agreement, made between carriers and relating to the provision of their joint services for carriage of passengers by air; (b)   “principal and permanent residence” means the one fixed and permanent abode of the passenger at the time of the accident. The nationality of the passenger shall not be the determining factor in this regard. 4.   Questions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the court seised of the case.  Article 34—Arbitration  1.   Subject to the provisions of this Article, the parties to the contract of carriage for cargo may stipulate that any dispute relating to the liability of the carrier under this Convention shall be settled by arbitration. Such agreement shall be in writing. 2.   The arbitration proceedings shall, at the option of the claimant, take place within one of the jurisdictions referred to in Article 33. 3.   The arbitrator or arbitration tribunal shall apply the provisions of this Conven‐ tion. 4.   The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall be deemed to be part of every arbitration clause or agreement, and any term of such clause or agreement which is inconsistent therewith shall be null and void.  Article 35—Limitation of actions  1.   The right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within a period of two years, reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the carriage stopped. 2.   The method of calculating that period shall be determined by the law of the court seised of the case.  Article 36—Successive carriage  1.   In the case of carriage to be performed by various successive carriers and falling within the definition set out in paragraph 3 of Article 1, each carrier which accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subject to the rules set out in this  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 349

Convention and is deemed to be one of the parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is performed under its supervision. 2.   In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or any person entitled to compensation in respect of him or her can take action only against the carrier which performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey. 3.   As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and further, each may take action against the carrier which performed the carriage during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place. These carriers will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or consignee.  Article 37—Right of recourse against third parties  Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the question whether a person liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse against any other person.  Chapter IV Combined carriage  Article 38—Combined carriage  1.   In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention shall, subject to paragraph 4 of Article 18, apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1. 2.   Nothing in this Convention shall prevent the parties in the case of combined carriage from inserting in the document of air carriage conditions relating to other modes of carriage, provided that the provisions of this Convention are observed as regards the carriage by air.  Chapter V Carriage by air performed by a person other than the contracting carrier  Article 39—Contracting carrier—Actual carrier  The provisions of this Chapter apply when a person (hereinafter referred to as “the contracting carrier”) as a principal makes a contract of carriage governed by this Convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger or consignor, and another person (hereinafter referred to as “the actual  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 350

carrier”) performs, by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, the whole or part of the carriage, but is not with respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of this Convention. Such authority shall be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.  Article 40—Respective liability of contracting and actual carriers  If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the contract referred to in Article 39, is governed by this Convention, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, be subject to the rules of this Convention, the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the contract, the latter solely for the carriage which it performs.  Article 41—Mutual liability  1.   The acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of its servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the contracting carrier. 2.   The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of its servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the actual carrier. Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability exceeding the amounts referred to in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24. Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights or defences conferred by this Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination contemplated in Article 22 shall not affect the actual carrier unless agreed to by it.  Article 42—Addressee of complaints and instructions  Any complaint to be made or instruction to be given under this Convention to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the actual carrier. Nevertheless, instructions referred to in Article 12 shall only be effective if addressed to the contracting carrier.  Article 43—Servants and agents  In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if they prove that they acted within the scope of their employment, be entitled to avail themselves of the conditions and limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent they are, unless it is proved that they acted in a manner that prevents the limits of liability from being invoked in accordance with this Convention.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 6 351

Article 44—Aggregation of damages  In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to that person.  Article 45—Addressee of claims  In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately. If the action is brought against only one of those carriers, that carrier shall have the right to require the other carrier to be joined in the proceedings, the procedure and effects being governed by the law of the court seised of the case.  Article 46—Additional jurisdiction  Any action for damages contemplated in Article 45 must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier, as provided in Article 33, or before the court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier has its domicile or its principal place of business.  Article 47—Invalidity of contractual provisions  Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the actual carrier of liability under this Chapter or to fix a lower limit than that which is applicable according to this Chapter shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Chapter.  Article 48—Mutual relations of contracting and actual carriers  Except as provided in Article 45, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the carriers between themselves, including any right of recourse or indemnification.  Chapter VI Other provisions  Article 49—Mandatory application  Any clause contained in the contract of carriage and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid  Schedule 6   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 352

down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void.  Article 50—Insurance  States Parties shall require their carriers to maintain adequate insurance covering their liability under this Convention. A carrier may be required by the State Party into which it operates to furnish evidence that it maintains adequate insurance covering its liability under this Convention.  Article 51—Carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances  The provisions of Articles 3 to 5, 7 and 8 relating to the documentation of carriage shall not apply in the case of carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of a carrier’s business.  Article 52—Definition of days  The expression “days” when used in this Convention means calendar days, not work‐ ing days.

Article 6—Relationship between the Convention and the Protocol  1.   This Convention and the Protocol shall be read and interpreted together as a single instrument. 2.   To the extent of any inconsistency between this Convention and the Protocol, the Protocol shall prevail.  Chapter II Constitution of an international interest  Article 7—Formal requirements  An interest is constituted as an international interest under this Convention where the agreement creating or providing for the interest: (a)   is in writing; (b)   relates to an object of which the chargor, conditional seller or lessor has power to dispose; (c)   enables the object to be identified in conformity with the Protocol; and (d)   in the case of a security agreement, enables the secured obligations to be determined, but without the need to state a sum or maximum sum secured.  Chapter III Default remedies  Article 8—Remedies of chargee  1.   In the event of default as provided in Article 11, the chargee may, to the extent that the chargor has at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, exercise any one or more of the following remedies: (a)   take possession or control of any object charged to it; (b)   sell or grant a lease of any such object; (c)   collect or receive any income or profits arising from the management or use of any such object. 2.   The chargee may alternatively apply for a court order authorising or directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph. 3.   Any remedy set out in sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 or by Article 13 shall be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner. A remedy shall be deemed to be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner where  Schedule 7   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 362

it is exercised in conformity with a provision of the security agreement except where such a provision is manifestly unreasonable. 4.   A chargee proposing to sell or grant a lease of an object under paragraph 1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the proposed sale or lease to: (a)   interested persons specified in Article 1(m)(i) and (ii); and (b)   interested persons specified in Article 1(m)(iii) who have given notice of their rights to the chargee within a reasonable time prior to the sale or lease. 5.   Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result of exercise of any of the remedies set out in paragraph 1 or 2 shall be applied towards discharge of the amount of the secured obligations. 6.   Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a result of the exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured by the security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of any such remedy, then unless otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall distribute the surplus among holders of subsequently ranking interests which have been registered or of which the chargee has been given notice, in order of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.  Article 9—Vesting of object in satisfaction; redemption  1.   At any time after default as provided in Article 11, the chargee and all the interested persons may agree that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations. 2.   The court may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of (or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations. 3.   The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only if the amount of the secured obligations to be satisfied by such vesting is commensu‐ rate with the value of the object after taking account of any payment to be made by the chargee to any of the interested persons. 4.   At any time after default as provided in Article 11 and before sale of the charged object or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or any interested person may discharge the security interest by paying in full the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the chargee under Article 8(1)(b) or ordered under Article 8(2). Where, after such default, the payment of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the debtor, that person is subrogated to the rights of the chargee.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 7 363

5.   Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a sale under Article 8(1)(b) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article is free from any other interest over which the chargee’s security interest has priority under the provisions of Article 29.  Article 10—Remedies of conditional seller or lessor  In the event of default under a title reservation agreement or under a leasing agree‐ ment as provided in Article 11, the conditional seller or the lessor, as the case may be, may: (a)   subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, terminate the agreement and take possession or control of any object to which the agreement relates; or (b)   apply for a court order authorising or directing either of these acts.  Article 11—Meaning of default  1.   The debtor and the creditor may at any time agree in writing as to the events that constitute a default or otherwise give rise to the rights and remedies specified in Articles 8 to 10 and 13. 2.   Where the debtor and the creditor have not so agreed, “default” for the pur‐ poses of Articles 8 to 10 and 13 means a default which substantially deprives the creditor of what it is entitled to expect under the agreement.  Article 12—Additional remedies  Any additional remedies permitted by the applicable law, including any remedies agreed upon by the parties, may be exercised to the extent that they are not inconsist‐ ent with the mandatory provisions of this Chapter as set out in Article 15.  Article 13—Relief pending final determination  1.   Subject to any declaration that it may make under Article 55, a Contracting State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests: (a)   preservation of the object and its value; (b)   possession, control or custody of the object; (c)   immobilisation of the object; and (d)   lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), management of the object and the income therefrom.

The Protocol and regulations shall specify the requirements, including the criteria for the identification of the object: (a)   for effecting a registration (which shall include provision for prior elec‐ tronic transmission of any consent from any person whose consent is required under Article 20); (b)   for making searches and issuing search certificates, and, subject thereto; (c)   for ensuring the confidentiality of information and documents of the International Registry other than information and documents relating to a registration. 2.   The Registrar shall not be under a duty to enquire whether a consent to regis‐ tration under Article 20 has in fact been given or is valid. 3.   Where an interest registered as a prospective international interest becomes an international interest, no further registration shall be required provided that the registration information is sufficient for a registration of an international interest. 4.   The Registrar shall arrange for registrations to be entered into the International Registry data base and made searchable in chronological order of receipt, and the file shall record the date and time of receipt. 5.   The Protocol may provide that a Contracting State may designate an entity or entities in its territory as the entry point or entry points through which the information required for registration shall or may be transmitted to the International Registry. A Contracting State making such a designation may specify the requirements, if any, to be satisfied before such information is transmitted to the International Registry.

(b)   the registration information, including the file number, is stored in dura‐ ble form and may be accessed at the International Registry. 4.   If an interest first registered as a prospective international interest becomes an international interest, that international interest shall be treated as registered from the time of registration of the prospective international interest provided that the registration was still current immediately before the international inter‐ est was constituted as provided by Article 7. 5.   The preceding paragraph applies with necessary modifications to the registra‐ tion of a prospective assignment of an international interest. 6.   A registration shall be searchable in the International Registry data base according to the criteria prescribed by the Protocol.  Article 20—Consent to registration  1.   An international interest, a prospective international interest or an assignment or prospective assignment of an international interest may be registered, and any such registration amended or extended prior to its expiry, by either party with the consent in writing of the other. 2.

A search certificate issued under the preceding paragraph shall indicate that the creditor named in the registration information has acquired or intends to acquire an international interest in the object but shall not indicate whether what is registered is an international interest or a prospective international interest, even if this is ascertainable from the relevant registration information.  Article 23—List of declarations and declared non-consensual rights or interests  The Registrar shall maintain a list of declarations, withdrawals of declaration and of the categories of nonconsensual right or interest communicated to the Registrar by the Depositary as having been declared by Contracting States in conformity with Articles 39 and 40 and the date of each such declaration or withdrawal of declaration. Such list shall be recorded and searchable in the name of the declaring State and shall be made available as provided in the Protocol and regulations to any person requesting it.

Where a registration ought not to have been made or is incorrect, the person in whose favour the registration was made shall, without undue delay, procure its discharge or amendment after written demand by the debtor delivered to or received at its address stated in the registration.

Schedule 7   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 370

6.   The Supervisory Authority may waive the inviolability and immunity con‐ ferred by paragraph 4.  Chapter VII Liability of the Registrar  Article 28—Liability and financial assurances  1.   The Registrar shall be liable for compensatory damages for loss suffered by a person directly resulting from an error or omission of the Registrar and its officers and employees or from a malfunction of the international registration system except where the malfunction is caused by an event of an inevitable and irresistible nature, which could not be prevented by using the best practices in current use in the field of electronic registry design and operation, including those related to back-up and systems security and networking. 2.   The Registrar shall not be liable under the preceding paragraph for factual inaccuracy of registration information received by the Registrar or transmitted by the Registrar in the form in which it received that information nor for acts or circumstances for which the Registrar and its officers and employees are not responsible and arising prior to receipt of registration information at the International Registry. 3.   Compensation under paragraph 1 may be reduced to the extent that the person who suffered the damage caused or contributed to that damage. 4.   The Registrar shall procure insurance or a financial guarantee covering the liability referred to in this Article to the extent determined by the Supervisory Authority, in accordance with the Protocol.  Chapter VIII Effects of an international interest as against third parties  Article 29—Priority of competing interests  1.   A registered interest has priority over any other interest subsequently registered and over an unregistered interest. 2.   The priority of the first-mentioned interest under the preceding paragraph applies: (a)   even if the first-mentioned interest was acquired or registered with actual knowledge of the other interest; and (b)   even as regards value given by the holder of the first-mentioned interest with such knowledge.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 7 371

3.   The buyer of an object acquires its interest in it: (a)   subject to an interest registered at the time of its acquisition of that interest; and (b)   free from an unregistered interest even if it has actual knowledge of such an interest. 4.   The conditional buyer or lessee acquires its interest in or right over that object: (a)   subject to an interest registered prior to the registration of the inter‐ national interest held by its conditional seller or lessor; and (b)   free from an interest not so registered at that time even if it has actual knowledge of that interest. 5.   The priority of competing interests or rights under this Article may be varied by agreement between the holders of those interests, but an assignee of a subor‐ dinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate that interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement. 6.   Any priority given by this Article to an interest in an object extends to pro‐ ceeds. 7.   This Convention: (a)   does not affect the rights of a person in an item, other than an object, held prior to its installation on an object if under the applicable law those rights continue to exist after the installation; and (b)   does not prevent the creation of rights in an item, other than an object, which has previously been installed on an object where under the applic‐ able law those rights are created.  Article 30—Effects of insolvency  1.   In insolvency proceedings against the debtor an international interest is effect‐ ive if prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings that interest was registered in conformity with this Convention. 2.   Nothing in this Article impairs the effectiveness of an international interest in the insolvency proceedings where that interest is effective under the applicable law. 3.   Nothing in this Article affects: (a)   any rules of law applicable in insolvency proceedings relating to the avoidance of a transaction as a preference or a transfer in fraud of creditors; or  Schedule 7   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 372

(b)   any rules of procedure relating to the enforcement of rights to property which is under the control or supervision of the insolvency administra‐ tor.  Chapter IX Assignments of associated rights and international interests; rights of subrogation  Article 31—Effects of assignment  1.   Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, an assignment of associated rights made in conformity with Article 32 also transfers to the assignee: (a)   the related international interest; and (b)   all the interests and priorities of the assignor under this Convention. 2.   Nothing in this Convention prevents a partial assignment of the assignor’s associated   rights.   In   the   case   of   such   a   partial   assignment   the   assignor and assignee may agree as to their respective rights concerning the related international interest assigned under the preceding paragraph but not so as adversely to affect the debtor without its consent. 3.   Subject to paragraph 4, the applicable law shall determine the defences and rights of set-off available to the debtor against the assignee. 4.   The debtor may at any time by agreement in writing waive all or any of the defences and rights of set-off referred to in the preceding paragraph other than defences arising from fraudulent acts on the part of the assignee. 5.   In the case of an assignment by way of security, the assigned associated rights revest in the assignor, to the extent that they are still subsisting, when the obligations secured by the assignment have been discharged.  Article 32—Formal requirements of assignment  1.   An assignment of associated rights transfers the related international interest only if it: (a)   is in writing; (b)   enables the associated rights to be identified under the contract from which they arise; and (c)   in the case of an assignment by way of security, enables the obligations secured by the assignment to be determined in accordance with the Protocol but without the need to state a sum or maximum sum secured.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 7 373

2.   An assignment of an international interest created or provided for by a security agreement is not valid unless some or all related associated rights also are assigned. 3.   This Convention does not apply to an assignment of associated rights which is not effective to transfer the related international interest.  Article 33—Debtor’s duty to assignee  1.   To the extent that associated rights and the related international interest have been transferred in accordance with Articles 31 and 32, the debtor in relation to those rights and that interest is bound by the assignment and has a duty to make payment or give other performance to the assignee, if but only if: (a)   the debtor has been given notice of the assignment in writing by or with the authority of the assignor; and (b)   the notice identifies the associated rights. 2.   Irrespective of any other ground on which payment or performance by the debtor discharges the latter from liability, payment or performance shall be effective for this purpose if made in accordance with the preceding paragraph. 3.   Nothing in this Article shall affect the priority of competing assignments.  Article 34—Default remedies in respect of assignment by way of security  In the event of default by the assignor under the assignment of associated rights and the related international interest made by way of security, Articles 8, 9 and 11 to 14 apply in the relations between the assignor and the assignee (and, in relation to associated rights, apply in so far as those provisions are capable of application to intangible property) as if references: (a)   to the secured obligation and the security interest were references to the obligation secured by the assignment of the associated rights and the related international interest and the security interest created by that assignment; (b)   to the chargee or creditor and chargor or debtor were references to the assignee and assignor; (c)   to the holder of the international interest were references to the assignee; and (d)   to the object were references to the assigned associated rights and the related international interest.  Article 35—Priority of competing assignments  1.   Where there are competing assignments of associated rights and at least one of the assignments includes the related international interest and is registered, the provisions of Article 29 apply as if the references to a registered interest  Schedule 7   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 374

were references to an assignment of the associated rights and the related regis‐ tered interest and as if references to a registered or unregistered interest were references to a registered or unregistered assignment. 2.   Article 30 applies to an assignment of associated rights as if the references to an international interest were references to an assignment of the associated rights and the related international interest.  Article 36—Assignee’s priority with respect to associated rights  1.   The assignee of associated rights and the related international interest whose assignment has been registered only has priority under Article 35(1) over another assignee of the associated rights: (a)   if the contract under which the associated rights arise states that they are secured by or associated with the object; and (b)   to the extent that the associated rights are related to an object. 2.   For the purposes of sub-paragraph (b) of the preceding paragraph, associated rights are related to an object only to the extent that they consist of rights to payment or performance that relate to: (a)   a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of the object; (b)   a sum advanced and utilised for the purchase of another object in which the assignor held another international interest if the assignor transferred that interest to the assignee and the assignment has been registered; (c)   the price payable for the object; (d)   the rentals payable in respect of the object; or (e)   other obligations arising from a transaction referred to in any of the preceding sub-paragraphs. 3.   In all other cases, the priority of the competing assignments of the associated rights shall be determined by the applicable law.  Article 37—Effects of assignor’s insolvency  The provisions of Article 30 apply to insolvency proceedings against the assignor as if references to the debtor were references to the assignor.  Article 38—Subrogation  1.   Subject to paragraph 2, nothing in this Convention affects the acquisition of associated rights and the related international interest by legal or contractual subrogation under the applicable law. 2.   The priority between any interest within the preceding paragraph and a com‐ peting interest may be varied by agreement in writing between the holders  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 7 375

of the respective interests but an assignee of a subordinated interest is not bound by an agreement to subordinate that interest unless at the time of the assignment a subordination had been registered relating to that agreement.  Chapter X Rights or interests subject to declarations by Contracting States  Article 39—Rights having priority without registration  1.   A Contracting State may at any time, in a declaration deposited with the Depositary of the Protocol declare, generally or specifically: (a)   those categories of non-consensual right or interest (other than a right or interest to which Article 40 applies) which under that State’s law have priority over an interest in an object equivalent to that of the holder of a registered international interest and which shall have priority over a registered international interest, whether in or outside insolvency proceedings; and (b)   that nothing in this Convention shall affect the right of a State or State entity, intergovernmental organisation or other private provider of public services to arrest or detain an object under the laws of that State for pay‐ ment of amounts owed to such entity, organisation or provider directly relating to those services in respect of that object or another object. 2.   A declaration made under the preceding paragraph may be expressed to cover categories that are created after the deposit of that declaration. 3.   A non-consensual right or interest has priority over an international interest if and only if the former is of a category covered by a declaration deposited prior to the registration of the international interest. 4.   Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, a Contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of, or accession to the Protocol, declare that a right or interest of a category covered by a declaration made under sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 1 shall have priority over an international interest registered prior to the date of such ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.  Article 40—Registrable non-consensual rights or interests  A Contracting State may at any time in a declaration deposited with the Depositary of the Protocol list the categories of non-consensual right or interest which shall be registrable under this Convention as regards any category of object as if the right or interest were an international interest and shall be regulated accordingly. Such a declaration may be modified from time to time.  Schedule 7   Civil Aviation Act 2023  Version as at 28 December 2024 376

Chapter XII Jurisdiction  Article 42—Choice of forum  1.   Subject to Articles 43 and 44, the courts of a Contracting State chosen by the parties to a transaction have jurisdiction in respect of any claim brought under this Convention, whether or not the chosen forum has a connection with the parties or the transaction. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive unless otherwise agreed between the parties. 2.   Any such agreement shall be in writing or otherwise concluded in accordance with the formal requirements of the law of the chosen forum.  Article 43—Jurisdiction under Article 13  1.   The courts of a Contracting State chosen by the parties and the courts of the Contracting State on the territory of which the object is situated have jurisdiction to grant relief under Article 13(1)(a), (b), (c) and Article 13(4) in respect of that object. 2.   Jurisdiction to grant relief under Article 13(1)(d) or other interim relief by virtue of Article 13(4) may be exercised either: (a)   by the courts chosen by the parties; or (b)   by the courts of a Contracting State on the territory of which the debtor is situated, being relief which, by the terms of the order granting it, is enforceable only in the territory of that Contracting State. 3.   A court has jurisdiction under the preceding paragraphs even if the final deter‐ mination of the claim referred to in Article 13(1) will or may take place in a court of another Contracting State or by arbitration.  Article 44—Jurisdiction to make orders against the Registrar  1.   The courts of the place in which the Registrar has its centre of administration shall have exclusive jurisdiction to award damages or make orders against the Registrar.  Version as at 28 December 2024   Civil Aviation Act 2023   Schedule 7 377

2.   Where a person fails to respond to a demand made under Article 25 and that person has ceased to exist or cannot be found for the purpose of enabling an order to be made against it requiring it to procure discharge of the registration, the courts referred to in the preceding paragraph shall have exclusive jurisdic‐ tion, on the application of the debtor or intending debtor, to make an order directed to the Registrar requiring the Registrar to discharge the registration. 3.   Where a person fails to comply with an order of a court having jurisdiction under this Convention or, in the case of a national interest, an order of a court of competent jurisdiction requiring that person to procure the amendment or discharge of a registration, the courts referred to in paragraph 1 may direct the Registrar to take such steps as will give effect to that order. 4.

A Regional Economic Integration Organisation which is constituted by sover‐ eign States and has competence over certain matters governed by this Conven‐ tion may similarly sign, accept, approve or accede to this Convention. The Regional Economic Integration Organisation shall in that case have the rights and obligations of a Contracting State, to the extent that that Organisation has competence over matters governed by this Convention. Where the number of Contracting States is relevant in this Convention, the Regional Economic Integration Organisation shall not count as a Contracting State in addition to its Member States which are Contracting States. 2.   The Regional Economic Integration Organisation shall, at the time of signature, acceptance, approval or accession, make a declaration to the Depositary speci‐ fying the matters governed by this Convention in respect of which competence has been transferred to that Organisation by its Member States. The Regional Economic Integration Organisation shall promptly notify the Depositary of any changes to the distribution of competence, including new transfers of competence, specified in the declaration under this paragraph. 3.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the provisions of Articles 8(4), 9(1), 16, Chapter V, Article 29, and any provisions of this Convention relating to registered interests shall apply to an internal transaction. 3.   Where notice of a national interest has been registered in the International Registry, the priority of the holder of that interest under Article 29 shall not be affected by the fact that such interest has become vested in another person by assignment or subrogation under the applicable law.  Article 51—Future Protocols  1.   The Depositary may create working groups, in co-operation with such relevant non-governmental organisations as the Depositary considers appropriate, to assess the feasibility of extending the application of this Convention, through one or more Protocols, to objects of any category of high-value mobile equip‐ ment, other than a category referred to in Article 2(3), each member of which is uniquely identifiable, and associated rights relating to such objects. 2.
