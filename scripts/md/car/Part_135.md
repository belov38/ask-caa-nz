Civil Aviation Rules   Part 135   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   79   CAA of NZ  Appendix C — Runways  This Appendix is referred to in rule 135.77.  C.1   Minimum runway widths  To determine the minimum runway width it is necessary to ascertain the aerodrome reference code (ARC) appropriate to the aeroplane type by using Table 1. The code is composed of two elements which are related to the aeroplane performance, characteristics, and dimensions. Element 1 is a number based on the aerodrome reference field length (ARFL) and element 2 is a letter based on the aeroplane wingspan and outer main gear wheel span.  C.1.1   Determining the ARC using Table 1  (a)   Firstly:   Determine the ARFL of the aeroplane to be operated. The ARFL is the minimum field length for take-off at maximum certificated take-off weight, at sea level, in standard atmospheric conditions, in still air, and with zero runway slope, as derived from the aircraft flight manual;  (b)   Secondly:   Determine the code number for element 1 applying the aeroplane’s aerodrome reference field length; and  (c)   Thirdly:   Determine the code letter of element 2 corresponding to the dimensions of the aeroplane’s wing and outer main gear span. The code letter for element 2 is the code letter which corresponds to the wingspan, or the outer main gear span, whichever gives the most demanding code letter. For instance, if code letter C corresponds to the aeroplane’s wingspan and code letter D corresponds to the aeroplane’s outer main gear span, the code letter selected would be D for that aeroplane type.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 135   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   81   CAA of NZ  C.1.2   Determining the minimum runway width using Table 2  Having determined the aeroplane’s ARC, the runway widths are determined by entering at the applicable code number and then moving across to the value under the applicable code letter. For instance, if the aeroplane ARC is 2C, the required runway width is 30 m.  Table 2.

(b)   When calculating the landing weight under paragraph (a), a holder of an air operator certificate must take account of—

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 135   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   82   CAA of NZ  (1)   aerodrome elevation; and  (2)   ambient temperature at the aerodrome; and  (3)   the type of runway surface and the runway surface condition; and  (4)   the runway slope in the direction of landing; and  (5)   not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the reported tailwind component.  (c)   For an aeroplane to land as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b), it is assumed that the aeroplane will land on the most favourable runway taking into account—  (1)   the forecast meteorological conditions; and  (2)   surrounding terrain; and  (3)   approach and landing aids; and  (4)   obstacles within the missed approach flight path.  (d)   If the holder of an air operator certificate is unable to comply with paragraph (c) for the destination aerodrome, the aeroplane may be dispatched if   an   alternate   aerodrome   is   designated   that   permits   compliance   with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c).  D.2   Permitted landing distance assessments – Wet or contaminated runway  A holder of an air operator certificate must carry out the following procedure under rule 135.233(b)(2) for calculating the landing distance where a runway is wet   or contaminated –  ensure that, for each aeroplane it operates, when the relevant weather reports or forecasts or a combination of them, indicate that the runway at the estimated time of arrival of its aeroplane may be wet or contaminated, the landing distance available is at least 115% of the landing distance required by paragraph D.1.
