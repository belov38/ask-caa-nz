Published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand  Part 140  Providers of Aviation Security Services  5 April 2025  CAA Consolidation

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 140   CAA Consolidation  This document is the current consolidated version of Part 140 produced by the Civil Aviation Authority, and serves as a reference only.   It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may be obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority or may be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 140 is to   set standards, specifications, restrictions, and requirements for the issue and exercise of an Aviation Security Service certificate under the Civil Aviation Act 2023, and to   fulfil New Zealand’s obligations under ICAO Annex 17 for organisations providing aviation security services:  •   at Tier 1 security designated aerodromes  •   at security designated navigation installations.  Part 140 prescribes requirements for the certification (entry standards), operation (continued operations), and safety audit (monitoring and evaluation) of persons providing aviation security services.  AvSec is not required to hold a certificate to provide aviation security services (see sections 134 and 136 of the Act), but is required to comply with all requirements imposed by these Rules on certificate holders, unless the Rules provide otherwise (see section 139). These Rules therefore specify which requirements apply to applicants and certificate holders do not apply to AvSec, and requirements that are different for AvSec.
