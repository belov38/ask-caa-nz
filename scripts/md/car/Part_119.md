It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may be obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority or may be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 119 is to set standards, specifications, restrictions, and requirements for the issue and exercise of an Air Operator certificate under the Civil Aviation Act 2023, and to ensure New Zealand meets and maintains applicable ICAO standards and recommended practices for air operations, which include Air Transport Operations (ATO) and Commercial Transport Operations (CTO). Part 119 prescribes specific requirements for the certification (entry standards), operation (continued operations), and safety audit (monitoring and evaluation) of operators carrying out air operations.  Part 119 introduces two levels of certification—  •   airline air operator certification that permits air operations in all sizes of aircraft  •   general aviation air operator certification that permits air operations in helicopters, and aeroplanes with nine or less passenger seats.
