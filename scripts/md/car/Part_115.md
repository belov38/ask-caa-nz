# Adventure Aviation Certification and Operations

Published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand  Part 115  Adventure Aviation - Certification and Operations  5 April 2025  CAA Consolidation

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 115   CAA Consolidation  This document is the current consolidated version of Part 115 produced by the Civil Aviation Authority, and serves as a reference only.   It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may be obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority or may be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 115 is to ensure that an effective safety culture is maintained in the certification and operation of the adventure aviation industry.  Part 115 requires adventure aviation operators to be certificated in much the same way as air transport operators who use helicopters and small aeroplanes and are required to be certificated under Parts 119 and 135. In particular, operators need to satisfy the Director, through their exposition, that:  •   they have appropriate management systems, structures, and operating procedures in place to ensure compliance with the relevant safety standards;  •   employees are appropriately qualified, and trained;  •   equipment is appropriate to the task and properly maintained; and key people are fit and proper to undertake their responsibilities.
