Noise abatement departure profile – procedure d  A pilot-in-command of an aircraft must—  (1)   from take-off to an altitude of not less than 800 feet above aerodrome elevation—  (i)   use take-off power; and  (ii)   use take-off flap; and  (iii)   climb at V 2   plus 10 to 20 knots.  (2)   at or above 800 feet—  (i)   initiate flaps and/or slats retraction; and  (ii)   reduce thrust by manual throttle reduction or by automatic means; and  (iii)   for aeroplanes not equipped with an operating automatic thrust restoration system, achieve and maintain not less than the thrust level necessary after thrust reduction to maintain, for the flaps-slats configuration of the aeroplane, the take-off flight path engine-inoperative climb gradients specified in FAR 25.111(c)(3) in the   event of an engine failure; and

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 93   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   23   CAA of NZ  (iv)   for aeroplanes equipped with an operational automatic thrust restoration system, achieve and maintain no less than the thrust level necessary after thrust reduction to maintain, for the flaps-slats configuration of the aeroplane, a take-off path engine inoperative climb gradient of zero percent, provided that the automatic thrust restoration system will, at least, restore sufficient thrust to maintain the   take-off   path   engine-inoperative   climb   gradients specified in FAR 25.111(c)(3) in the   event of an engine failure; and  (v)   during the thrust reduction, co-ordinate the pitchover rate and   thrust   reduction   to   provide   a   decrease   in   pitch consistent with allowing indicated airspeed to decay no more than 5 knots below the all engine target climb speed and,   in   no   case,   to   less   than   V 2   for   the   aeroplane configuration; and  (vi)   maintain the speed and thrust requirements specified in (i) through (iv) to the higher of 3000 feet above the aerodrome elevation, or until the aeroplane has been fully transitioned   to   the   en-route climb   configuration,   then transition to normal en-route climb procedures.
