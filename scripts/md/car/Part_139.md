Part 139 prescribes the requirements for—  •   the certification and operation of aerodromes;  •   the security measures applicable to aerodromes;  •   the use of aerodromes by aircraft operators;  •   the provision of UNICOM and AWIB services.  Part 139 prescribes specific requirements for the certification (entry standards), operation (continued operations), and safety audit (surveillance) of aerodromes. Part 139 also details required security measures for aerodrome certificate holders.

(b)   A   certificate   holder   who   deviates   under   paragraph   (a)   from   a requirement in Subpart C or Subpart D, or under paragraph (aa) from a requirement in Subpart G or Subpart H, must provide a written report to the Director as soon as practicable, but not later than 14 days after the emergency.  (c)   The report required under paragraph (b) must specify the nature, extent, and duration of the deviation.  139.19   Requirements for non-certificated aerodromes  A person operating an aerodrome that is not operated under the authority of an   aerodrome   operator   certificate   or   a   qualifying   aerodrome   operator certificate must comply with the requirements in Subpart I of this Part.  Subpart AA — Determination of qualifying aerodrome  139.21   Aeronautical study  (a)   An aerodrome operator that does not hold an aerodrome operator certificate or a qualifying aerodrome operator certificate may be required by the Director to provide an aeronautical study if —

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 139   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   13   CAA of NZ  (1)   the Director considers that a significant change has occurred or on reasonable grounds is likely to occur that may affect the operation or use of the aerodrome; or  (2)   a significant concern indicating risk to aviation safety is raised by any person; or  (3)   the Director has issued a conditional determination under rule 157.11(a)(2) in relation to—  (i)   a change of the type described in paragraph (a)(1); or  (ii)   a concern of the type described in paragraph (a)(2); or  (4)   the Director has issued an objectionable determination under rule 157.11(a)(3) in relation to—  (i)   a change of the type described in paragraph (a)(1); or  (ii)   a concern of the type described in paragraph (a)(2).  (b)   For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1), a significant change includes—  (1)   the commencement or proposed commencement of a regular air operation using an aeroplane that has—  (i)   a certificated seating capacity of more than 9 passengers; or  (ii)   a payload capacity of 3410 kg or less and a MCTOW of greater than 5700 kg; or  (iii)   a   single   engine   and   performs   an   SEIFR   passenger operation; or  (2)   a significant increase in aerodrome aircraft traffic volumes; or  (3)   a significant change in type of aircraft using, or type of aircraft operations carried out at, the aerodrome; or  (4)   a significant change in the aerodrome’s physical characteristics; or
