C.1   Minimum runway widths  To determine the minimum runway width it is necessary to ascertain the aerodrome reference code (ARC) appropriate to the aeroplane type by using Table 1. The code is composed of two elements which are related to the aeroplane performance, characteristics, and dimensions. Element 1 is a number based on the aeroplane reference field length (ARFL) and element 2 is a letter based on the aeroplane wing span and outer main gear wheel span.  C.1.1   Determining the ARC using Table 1  (a)   Firstly:   Determine the ARFL of the aeroplane to be operated. The ARFL is the minimum field length for take-off at maximum certificated take-off weight, at sea level, in standard atmospheric conditions, in still air, and with zero runway slope, as derived from the aircraft flight manual;  (b)   Secondly:   Determine the code number for element 1 applying the aeroplane’s aerodrome reference field length; and  (c)   Thirdly:   Determine the code letter of element 2 corresponding to the dimensions of the aeroplane’s wing and outer main gear span. The code letter for element 2 is the code letter which corresponds to the wing span, or the outer main gear span, whichever gives the most demanding code letter. For instance, if code letter C corresponds to the aeroplane’s wing span and code letter D corresponds to the aeroplane’s outer main gear span, the code letter selected would be D for that aeroplane type.

Part 121, Initial Issue   Part 121   Air Operations — Large Aeroplanes  5 April 2025   164   CAA of NZ  Appendix D — Landing Distance Assessments for Runways  D.1   Permitted landing distance assessments – Dry runway  The following procedure must be carried out by a holder of an air operator certificate under rule 121.221(b)(2) for calculating the landing distance where a runway is dry:  (a)   A holder of an air operator certificate must ensure that, for each aeroplane it operates, the landing weight for the estimated time of landing allows a full stop landing on a dry runway from a point 50 feet above the threshold within—  (1)   60% of the landing distance available for a turbojet or turbofan powered aeroplane; and  (2)   70% of the landing distance available for a propeller-powered aeroplane.  (b)   When   calculating   the   landing   weight   under   paragraph (a),   the certificate holder must take account of—  (1)   aerodrome elevation; and  (2)   ambient temperature at the aerodrome; and  (3)   the type of runway surface and the runway surface condition; and  (4)   the runway slope in the direction of landing; and  (5)   not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the reported tailwind component.  (c)   The certificate holder must, for an aeroplane to land as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b), assume that the aeroplane will land on the most favourable runway taking into account—  (1)   the forecast meteorological conditions; and  (2)   surrounding terrain; and  (3)   approach and landing aids; and

Part 121, Initial Issue   Part 121   Air Operations — Large Aeroplanes  5 April 2025   165   CAA of NZ  (4)   obstacles within the missed approach flight path.  (d)   If the certificate holder is unable to comply with paragraph (c) for the destination aerodrome, the certificate holder may dispatch an aeroplane if an alternate aerodrome is designated that permits compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c).  D.2   Permitted landing distance assessments – Wet or contaminated runway  A holder of an air operator certificate must carry out the following procedure under rule 121.221(b)(2) for calculating the landing distance where a runway is wet or contaminated:  (a)   A holder of an air operator certificate must ensure that, for each aeroplane it operates—  (1)   when   the   appropriate   weather   reports   or   forecasts   or   a combination of them, indicate that the runway at the estimated time of arrival may be wet, the landing distance available is at least 115% of the landing distance required by paragraph D.1; and  (2)   when   the   appropriate   weather   reports   or   forecasts   or   a combination of them, indicate that the runway at the estimated time   of   arrival   may   be   contaminated,   the   landing   distance available is at least—  (i)   115% of the landing distance required by paragraph D.1; or  (ii)   the   landing   distance   determined   in   accordance   with contaminated-landing-distance data.  (b)   A landing distance on a wet runway shorter than that required by paragraph (a), but not less than that required by paragraph D.1, may be used if performance data allows a shorter landing distance on wet runways.
