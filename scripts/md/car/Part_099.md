Specifically, the rules are required to:  •   identify DAMP (Drug and Alcohol Management Plan) operators for the purposes of section 113 of the 2023 Act  •   prescribe notification, reporting and administrative matters, and provide for some matters to be dealt with in transport instruments made separately by the Director of Civil Aviation  •   manage the two-year transition period (from 5 April 2025 to 4 April 2027) so that CAA is able to efficiently consider DAMPs submitted to it for approval, and  •   make amendments to existing rule parts so that Drug and Alcohol Management Plans (DAMPs) become part of operator expositions after the transition period and can be updated.
