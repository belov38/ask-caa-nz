# Instrument Flight Procedure Service Organisation - Certification and Operation

Published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand  Part 173  Instrument Flight Procedure Service Organisation - Certification and Operation  5 April 2025  CAA Consolidation

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 173   CAA Consolidation  This document is the current consolidated version of Part 173 produced by the Civil Aviation Authority, and serves as a reference only.   It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may be obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority or may be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 173 is to set standards, specifications, restrictions, and requirements for the issue and exercise of an Instrument Flight Procedure Service Organisation certificate under the Civil Aviation Act 2023.  This includes certification and operating requirements for organisations that provide services for the design and maintenance of instrument flight procedures (including the technical standards for the design of instrument flight procedures).  Part 173 aims to ensure that the design, maintenance, and promulgation of instrument flight procedures intended for use by aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) in the New Zealand Flight Information Region (NZFIR) meet or exceed the applicable ICAO standards and recommended practices for instrument flight procedures.  The Part does not apply to the design of aircraft performance operating limitations or flight paths for critical engine inoperative emergency procedures.
