# Designation and Classification of Airspace

Published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand  Part 71  Designation and Classification of Airspace  5 April 2025  CAA Consolidation

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 71   CAA Consolidation  This document is the current consolidated version of Part 71 produced by the Civil Aviation Authority, and serves as a reference only.   It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may   be   obtained   from   the   Civil   Aviation   Authority   or   may   be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 71 is to maintain a safe aviation system through ensuring New Zealand meets and maintains applicable ICAO standards and recommended practices related to the designation and classification of airspace for aviation purposes and in the public interest.  Part 71 empowers the Director as the person who may designate and classify airspace for aviation purposes in New Zealand’s domestic airspace (New Zealand Flight Information Region) and in the airspace over the high seas for which New Zealand has accepted responsibility for the management of the airspace under an ICAO Regional Air Navigation Agreement (Auckland Oceanic Flight Information Region).  Part 71 also empowers the Director to restrict aviation activity by the designation of special use airspace.

(f)   A using agency nominated under paragraph (b)(1) must satisfy the Director, if requested to, that the using agency continues to have the consent referred to in paragraph (e)(2).  Subpart E—Transponder mandatory airspace  71.201   Transponder mandatory airspace within controlled airspace  The Director may designate a control area or a control zone, or any portion of a control area or a control zone, as transponder mandatory airspace if—  (1)   the operation of transponders is required for the provision of an air traffic control surveillance service; or  (2)   the Director determines that the traffic density in the airspace requires the operation of transponders to reduce the risk of an airborne collision with those aircraft that are required to be fitted with an airborne collision avoidance system.  71.203   Transponder mandatory airspace within special use airspace  The Director may designate any portion of special use airspace as transponder mandatory airspace if the Director determines that the traffic density in the airspace requires the operation of transponders to reduce the risk of an

Subpart F—Miscellaneous  71.251   Visual reporting points  (a)   The Director may designate visual reporting points for the purpose of—  (1)   facilitating   the   requirements   of   air   traffic   services   for information regarding the progress of aircraft in flight; or  (2)   facilitating the safe conduct of flight by visual reference.  (b)   The Director must ensure that visual reporting points —  (1)   are based on prominent geographical features; and  (2)   are identified by names or designators that—  (i)   are easily recognisable in voice communications; and  (ii)   will not be confused with those of other reporting points in the same general area; and  (iii)   do   not   create   confusion   with   other   communications exchanged between pilots and between air traffic services and pilots.  71.253   Area QNH zones  The Director may designate as an area QNH zone those portions of airspace from the surface of the earth to a specified altitude within which a common area QNH altimeter setting must be used.  71.255   Mountainous zones  The Director may designate a portion of airspace as a mountainous zone if, in the interests of safety, the Director considers it necessary to increase the minimum obstacle clearance to provide additional height above terrain for IFR flights to   accommodate   the   possible   effects of   turbulence,   down draughts, and other meteorological phenomena on the performance of aircraft.
