Published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand  Part 71  Designation and Classification of Airspace  5 April 2025  CAA Consolidation

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 71   CAA Consolidation  This document is the current consolidated version of Part 71 produced by the Civil Aviation Authority, and serves as a reference only.   It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may   be   obtained   from   the   Civil   Aviation   Authority   or   may   be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 71 is to maintain a safe aviation system through ensuring New Zealand meets and maintains applicable ICAO standards and recommended practices related to the designation and classification of airspace for aviation purposes and in the public interest.  Part 71 empowers the Director as the person who may designate and classify airspace for aviation purposes in New Zealand’s domestic airspace (New Zealand Flight Information Region) and in the airspace over the high seas for which New Zealand has accepted responsibility for the management of the airspace under an ICAO Regional Air Navigation Agreement (Auckland Oceanic Flight Information Region).  Part 71 also empowers the Director to restrict aviation activity by the designation of special use airspace.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   16   CAA of NZ  Appendix A — Obstacle Notification Surfaces

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   17   CAA of NZ  Appendix B — Visual Aids for denoting obstacles  B.1   Obstacles  For the purpose of this Appendix the term obstacle is used to refer to those objects that the Director has determined to be a hazard under rule 77.21.  B.2   Obstacles to be marked or lighted  (a)   A fixed obstacle that extends above the obstacle limitation surfaces required by Part 139 must be marked and, if the aerodrome is used at night, lighted, except that—  (1)   the marking may be omitted when the obstacle is lighted by high- intensity obstacle lights by day; and  (2)   the lighting may be omitted where the obstacle is a lighthouse and an   aeronautical   study   indicates   the   lighthouse   light   to   be sufficient; and  (3)   such marking or lighting may be omitted when—  (i)   the obstacle is shielded by another fixed obstacle already marked or lighted; or  (ii)   for a circuit extensively obstructed by immovable objects or terrain, procedures have been established to ensure safe vertical clearance below prescribed flight paths; or  (iii)   an aeronautical study shows the obstacle not to be of operational significance.  (b)   A fixed obstacle that meets or exceeds any of the standards for determining hazards under rule 77.19, not included in paragraph (a), must be marked or lighted except that—  (1)   the marking may be omitted when the obstacle is lighted by high- intensity obstacle lights by day; and  (2)   the lighting may be omitted where the obstacle is a lighthouse and an   aeronautical   study   indicates   the   lighthouse   light   to   be sufficient; and

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   18   CAA of NZ  (3)   the marking or lighting may be omitted when—  (i)   the obstacle is shielded by another fixed obstacle already marked or lighted; or  (ii)   an aeronautical study shows the obstacle not to be of operational significance.  B.3   General  All fixed obstacles to be marked must be coloured, but if this is impracticable, markers or flags must be displayed on or above them, except that the obstacles that are sufficiently conspicuous by their shape, size, or colour need not be otherwise marked.  B.4   Use of colours  (a)   An obstacle, if its projection on any vertical plane has both dimensions less than 1500 mm, must be marked by a single conspicuous colour being orange or red, unless those colours merge with the   background.  (b)   An obstacle, if it has essentially unbroken surfaces and its projection on any vertical plane equals or exceeds 4500 mm in both dimensions, must be marked by—  (1)   orange and white, or red and white, except where such colours merge with the background; and  (2)   a chequered pattern of squares of not less than 1500 mm and not more than 3000 mm on a side, the corners being of the darker colour. See figure B.1.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   19   CAA of NZ  Figure B.1   – Basic marking patterns  (c)   An obstacle must be marked by alternating contrasting coloured bands if—  (1)   it has essentially unbroken surfaces and has one dimension, horizontal or vertical, greater than 1500 mm, and the other dimension, horizontal or vertical, less than 4500 mm; or  (2)   it is of skeletal type with either a vertical or a horizontal dimension greater than 1500 mm. See figure B.1.  (d)   The bands referred to in paragraph (c) must—  (1)   be perpendicular to the longest dimension; and  (2)   have a width approximately one seventh of the longest dimension or 30 m, whichever is less; and  (3)   be coloured orange and white unless those colours are not conspicuous when viewed against the background; and  (4)   be so placed that the bands on the extremities of the obstacle are of the darker colour.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   20   CAA of NZ  (e)   Table B.1 shows a formula for determining band widths to ensure an odd number of bands, thus permitting the extreme bands to be of the darker colour. Also see Figure B.1.  Table B.1   – Band Widths  Longest dimension  Band width Greater than   Not exceeding  1.5 m   210 m   1/7 of longest dimension  210 m   270 m   1/9 of longest dimension  270 m   330 m   1/11 of longest dimension  330 m   390 m   1/13 of longest dimension  390 m   450 m   1/15 of longest dimension  450 m   510 m   1/17 of longest dimension  510 m   570 m   1/19 of longest dimension  570 m   630 m   1/21 of longest dimension  B.5   Use of markers  Markers displayed on or adjacent to obstacles must—  (1)   be located in conspicuous positions so as to retain the general definition of the obstacle; and  (2)   be recognisable in all directions in which an aircraft is likely to approach the object, in clear weather, from a distance of at least—  (i)   1000 m for an obstacle to be viewed from the air; and  (ii)   300 m for an obstacle to be viewed from the ground; and  (3)   have a distinctive shape to the extent necessary to ensure they are not mistaken for markers employed to convey other information; and

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   21   CAA of NZ  (4)   be such that the hazard presented by the obstacle they mark is not increased.  B.6   Use of flags  (a)   Flags used to mark obstacles must be—  (1)   displayed around, on top of, or around the highest edge of, the object; and  (2)   be such that the hazard presented by the obstacle they mark is not increased.  (b)   When flags are used to mark extensive obstacles or groups of closely spaced obstacles, they must be displayed at least every 15 m.  (c)   Flags used to mark fixed obstacles must—  (1)   not be less than 600 mm by 600 mm; and  (2)   be orange in colour or a combination of two triangular sections, one orange and the other white, or one red and the other white, except that where such colours merge with the background other conspicuous colours must be used.  (d)   Flags used to mark mobile obstacles must—  (1)   not be less than 900 mm by 900 mm; and  (2)   consist of a chequered pattern—  (i)   each square having sides of not less than 300 mm; and  (ii)   the colours of each square contrasting with each other and with the background against which they will be seen; and  (iii)   coloured orange and white, or red and white, except where such colours merge with the background.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   22   CAA of NZ  B.7   Use of obstacle lights  (a)   Where an obstacle is required to be lighted, it must be by low-, medium-, or high-intensity obstacle lights, or a combination of such lights.  (b)   Light intensity must be such that the hazard presented by the obstacle they mark is not increased.  (c)   Where the use of low-intensity obstacle lights would be inadequate or an early special warning is required, then medium or high-intensity obstacle lights must be used.  (d)   Medium-intensity obstacle lights must be used, either alone or in combination   with   low-intensity   obstacle   lights,   where   the   obstacle   is extensive or its height is greater than 45 m.  (e)   High-intensity obstacle lights are intended for day use as well as night use.  (f)   High-intensity obstacle lights must be used to indicate the presence of an obstacle, if its height exceeds 150 m.  B.8   Location of obstacle lights  (a)   Where lighting is required, at least one obstacle light must be located at the top of the obstacle except in the case of a chimney type structure where the top lights must be placed sufficiently below the top so as to minimise contamination by emissions.  (b)   Where the top of an obstacle is more than 45 m above the level of the surrounding ground, lights must be provided at intermediate levels that—  (1)   must be spaced as equally as practicable between the top light and ground level; and  (2)   if low-intensity or medium-intensity lights are used, are spaced no more than 45 m apart.  (c)   Where high-intensity obstacle lights are used on an obstacle the lights must be spaced no more than 105 m apart.  (d)   The number and arrangement of lights at each level to be marked must be such that the obstacle is marked from every angle in azimuth.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   23   CAA of NZ  (e)   Where a light on an obstacle is shielded in any direction by another object, an additional or substitute light must be provided on the obstacle in such a way as to retain its general definition.  (f)   The top light must be placed—  (1)   to indicate the points or edges of the obstacle that are highest in relation to the obstacle limitation surface; and  (2)   to indicate the points or edges of the obstacle that are highest in relation to sea level; and  (3)   in the case of a chimney type structure, between 1500 mm and 3000 mm below the top (See Figs B.2 and B.3); and  (4)   in the case of a guyed tower or antenna that should have a high intensity obstacle light at the top but where it is impracticable to do so, at the highest practicable point, and a medium-intensity obstacle light showing white mounted on the top.  (g)   An extensive obstacle or a group of closely spaced obstacles must—  (1)   display top lights on the points or edges of the obstacles highest in relation to the obstacle limitation surface, so as to indicate the general definition and extent of the obstacles; and  (2)   if two or more edges are of the same height, display lights on the edge nearest the landing area; and  (3)   where low intensity lights are required, be spaced no more than 45 m apart; and  (4)   where medium-intensity lights are required, be spaced no more than 90 m apart.

(b)   A low intensity obstacle light on a mobile obstacle must—  (1)   be yellow or, if yellow is not suitable, red; and  (2)   flash at a frequency between 60 and 90 per minute; and  (3)   have an effective intensity not less than 40 cd of yellow or red light.  B.10   Medium-intensity obstacle light characteristics  A medium-intensity obstacle light must—

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   26   CAA of NZ  (1)   be red except when used in conjunction with a high-intensity obstacle light, in which case it must be white; and  (2)   flash at a frequency between 20 and 60 per minute; and  (3)   have an effective intensity of not less than 1600 cd of red light.  B.11   High-intensity obstacle light characteristics  A high-intensity obstacle light must—  (1)   be white; and  (2)   flash simultaneously at a rate between 40 and 60 per minute; and  (3)   except when located on a tower supporting overhead lines, have an effective intensity that is variable and dependent on the background luminance as follows:  Background luminance   Effective intensity  above 500 cd/m²   200 000 cd minimum  50 to 500 cd/m²   20 000 cd ± 25%  less than 50 cd/m²   2000 cd ± 25%

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 77   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   27   CAA of NZ  Appendix C — Shielding  (a)   An object that is determined by the Director to be a hazard in navigable airspace may not be required to be marked or lighted if the Director considers the object to be shielded.  (b)   An object that is a lower height than another object—  (1)   already considered to be a hazard in navigable airspace; and  (2)   that is marked by standard obstacle marking or lighting—  may be considered to be shielded by the other object.  (c)   An aeronautical study may be required to determine whether an object that penetrates an obstacle limitation surface is shielded.  (d)   A shielding object must be permanent.  (e)   For the purposes of paragraph (d) an object may be classed as permanent only if, when taking the longest view possible, there is no prospect of removal being practicable, possible, or justifiable, regardless of how the pattern, type, or density of air operations might change.  (f)   Where the obstacle being shielded lies within the approach or take-off surface, or the transitional side or inner horizontal surface, it must meet the criteria illustrated in figures C.1 and C.2 in relation to the shielding object.  (g)   Where the obstacle lies outside of the areas referred to in paragraph (e) it may be considered shielded if located within 600 m of the shielding object.

# Adventure Aviation Certification and Operations

Published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand  Part 115  Adventure Aviation - Certification and Operations  5 April 2025  CAA Consolidation

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 115   CAA Consolidation  This document is the current consolidated version of Part 115 produced by the Civil Aviation Authority, and serves as a reference only.   It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may be obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority or may be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 115 is to ensure that an effective safety culture is maintained in the certification and operation of the adventure aviation industry.  Part 115 requires adventure aviation operators to be certificated in much the same way as air transport operators who use helicopters and small aeroplanes and are required to be certificated under Parts 119 and 135. In particular, operators need to satisfy the Director, through their exposition, that:  •   they have appropriate management systems, structures, and operating procedures in place to ensure compliance with the relevant safety standards;  •   employees are appropriately qualified, and trained;  •   equipment is appropriate to the task and properly maintained; and key people are fit and proper to undertake their responsibilities.

Part 121, Initial Issue   Part 121   Air Operations — Large Aeroplanes  5 April 2025   122   CAA of NZ  (e)   If the pilot-in-command of an aeroplane performing an EDTO is advised of a significant change in the conditions at an en-route EDTO alternate aerodrome listed in the dispatch release after the aeroplane has proceeded beyond the EDTO entry point, and the change in conditions makes the aerodrome no longer usable as an en-route EDTO alternate aerodrome, the pilot-in-command may only continue the flight if the pilot- in-command is satisfied that doing so would be safer than an alternative course of action.  (f)   For the purpose of paragraphs (a), (b) and (e), a significant change in the conditions at an en-route EDTO alternate aerodrome includes:  (i)   a change in the meteorological aerodrome forecast for the aerodrome that indicates that the weather conditions at the time of expected use will be below the landing minima for the aerodrome:  (ii)   a change in the condition of the aerodrome or services at the aerodrome that makes the aerodrome unsuitable as an EDTO alternate aerodrome.  121.975   EDTO fuel requirements  (a)   A holder of an air operator certificate who is authorised under this Subpart to conduct an EDTO must not allow an aeroplane to be dispatched on an EDTO unless, in addition to the requirements of the certificate holder’s fuel policy required by rule 121.75, the following requirements are met:  (1)   the aeroplane must carry the greater of the following—  (i)   sufficient   fuel   to   fly   to   an   en-route   EDTO   alternate aerodrome listed in the dispatch release assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point followed by a descent to a safe altitude in compliance with rule 91.423, and rule 91.209 relating to the use of oxygen equipment, or  (ii)   sufficient   fuel   to   fly   to   an   en-route   EDTO   alternate aerodrome listed in the dispatch release at the approved one engine inoperative cruise speed assuming a rapid decompression and a simultaneous engine failure at the most critical point followed by a descent to a safe altitude

Part 121, Initial Issue   Part 121   Air Operations — Large Aeroplanes  5 April 2025   123   CAA of NZ  in   compliance   with   rule   91.423   and   the   oxygen requirements of rule 91.209; or  (iii)   sufficient   fuel   to   fly   to   an   en-route   EDTO   alternate aerodrome listed in the dispatch release at the approved one engine inoperative cruise speed assuming an engine failure at the most critical point followed by a descent to the one engine inoperative cruise altitude; or  (iv)   EDTO critical fuel for the aeroplane;  (2)   the   aeroplane,   upon   reaching   the   en-route   EDTO   alternate aerodrome must have sufficient fuel to hold for 15 minutes at 1,500 feet above the aerodrome elevation and then to conduct an instrument approach procedure and land.  (b)   For the purposes of calculating the fuel required by paragraph (a), the certificate holder must take the following matters into account:  (1)   if the certificate holder is using a wind forecast model acceptable to the Director, a 5% wind speed factor (i.e. as an increment to a headwind or as a decrement to a tailwind) must be added onto the actual or forecast wind used to calculate the fuel required by paragraph (a)(1) to account for errors in wind forecasting:  (2)   if the certificate holder is not using a wind forecast model acceptable to the Director, the aeroplane must carry an additional 5% of the fuel required by paragraph (a)(1) to allow for errors in wind forecasting:  (3)   if icing conditions are forecast for the planned EDTO, the fuel required by paragraph (a)(1) must compensate for the greater of—  (i)   the effect of airframe icing during 10% of the time during which icing is forecast taking into account the fuel that would be used by the use of engine and wing anti-ice during the same period; or  (ii)   the fuel used by use of engine anti-ice systems, and if appropriate the use of wing anti-ice systems for the entire time during which icing is forecast:

Part 121, Initial Issue   Part 121   Air Operations — Large Aeroplanes  5 April 2025   124   CAA of NZ  (4)   the fuel required by paragraph (a)(1) must include—  (i)   additional   fuel,   calculated   in   accordance   with   the certificate holder’s performance deterioration allowance monitoring programme to compensate for any increase in the aeroplane’s fuel consumption; or  (ii)   if   a   performance   deterioration   allowance   monitoring programme   is   not   used   for   the   aeroplane’s   fuel consumption, an additional 5% of the fuel required by paragraph (a)(1) to account for the deterioration in cruise fuel burn performance:  (5)   if an APU is a required power source for operating the aeroplane on an EDTO, the fuel required by paragraph (a)(1) must include the APU fuel consumption during every phase of flight when the APU may be used:  (6)   the fuel required by paragraph (a)(1) must include any additional fuel consumption caused by the use of an MEL or configuration deviation list item for any applicable phases of flight.  121.977   En-route EDTO alternate aerodrome planning minima  Except as provided in rule 121.979, the applicable minima for an aerodrome to be listed as an en-route EDTO alternate aerodrome under rule 121.969 are specified in the following table:  Facilities available at  EDTO en-route alternate  Ceiling   Visibility  Two or More Separate  Precision Approach Procedure Equipped Runways  (Note: A single runway with reciprocal precision approach  Cloud - base of 400  feet or a cloud-base of 200 feet above the lowest aerodrome landing minimum; whichever is higher.

Part 121, Initial Issue   Part 121   Air Operations — Large Aeroplanes  5 April 2025   161   CAA of NZ  Appendix C — Runways  This Appendix is referred to in 121.71.  C.1   Minimum runway widths  To determine the minimum runway width it is necessary to ascertain the aerodrome reference code (ARC) appropriate to the aeroplane type by using Table 1. The code is composed of two elements which are related to the aeroplane performance, characteristics, and dimensions. Element 1 is a number based on the aeroplane reference field length (ARFL) and element 2 is a letter based on the aeroplane wing span and outer main gear wheel span.  C.1.1   Determining the ARC using Table 1  (a)   Firstly:   Determine the ARFL of the aeroplane to be operated. The ARFL is the minimum field length for take-off at maximum certificated take-off weight, at sea level, in standard atmospheric conditions, in still air, and with zero runway slope, as derived from the aircraft flight manual;  (b)   Secondly:   Determine the code number for element 1 applying the aeroplane’s aerodrome reference field length; and  (c)   Thirdly:   Determine the code letter of element 2 corresponding to the dimensions of the aeroplane’s wing and outer main gear span. The code letter for element 2 is the code letter which corresponds to the wing span, or the outer main gear span, whichever gives the most demanding code letter. For instance, if code letter C corresponds to the aeroplane’s wing span and code letter D corresponds to the aeroplane’s outer main gear span, the code letter selected would be D for that aeroplane type.

(b)   When   calculating   the   landing   weight   under   paragraph (a),   the certificate holder must take account of—  (1)   aerodrome elevation; and  (2)   ambient temperature at the aerodrome; and  (3)   the type of runway surface and the runway surface condition; and  (4)   the runway slope in the direction of landing; and  (5)   not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the reported tailwind component.  (c)   The certificate holder must, for an aeroplane to land as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b), assume that the aeroplane will land on the most favourable runway taking into account—  (1)   the forecast meteorological conditions; and  (2)   surrounding terrain; and  (3)   approach and landing aids; and

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 125   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   133   CAA of NZ  Appendix C — Runways  This Appendix is referred to in rule 125.77.  C.1   Minimum runway widths  To determine the minimum runway width it is necessary to ascertain the aerodrome reference code (ARC) appropriate to the aeroplane type by using Table 1. The code is composed of two elements which are related to the aeroplane performance, characteristics, and dimensions. Element 1 is a number based on the aerodrome reference field length (ARFL) and element 2 is a letter based on the aeroplane wing span and outer main gear wheel span.  C.1.1   Determining the ARC using Table 1  (a)   Firstly:   Determine the ARFL of the aeroplane to be operated. The ARFL is the minimum field length for take-off at maximum certificated take-off weight, at sea level, in standard atmospheric conditions, in still air, and with zero runway slope, as derived from the aeroplane flight manual;  (b)   Secondly:   Determine the code number for element 1 applying the aeroplane’s aerodrome reference field length; and  (c)   Thirdly:   Determine the code letter of element 2 corresponding to the dimensions of the aeroplane’s wing and outer main gear span. The code letter for element 2 is the code letter which corresponds to the wing span, or the outer main gear span, whichever gives the most demanding code letter. For instance, if code letter C corresponds to the aeroplane’s wing span and code letter D corresponds to the aeroplane’s outer main gear span, the code letter selected would be D for that aeroplane type.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 135   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   79   CAA of NZ  Appendix C — Runways  This Appendix is referred to in rule 135.77.  C.1   Minimum runway widths  To determine the minimum runway width it is necessary to ascertain the aerodrome reference code (ARC) appropriate to the aeroplane type by using Table 1. The code is composed of two elements which are related to the aeroplane performance, characteristics, and dimensions. Element 1 is a number based on the aerodrome reference field length (ARFL) and element 2 is a letter based on the aeroplane wingspan and outer main gear wheel span.  C.1.1   Determining the ARC using Table 1  (a)   Firstly:   Determine the ARFL of the aeroplane to be operated. The ARFL is the minimum field length for take-off at maximum certificated take-off weight, at sea level, in standard atmospheric conditions, in still air, and with zero runway slope, as derived from the aircraft flight manual;  (b)   Secondly:   Determine the code number for element 1 applying the aeroplane’s aerodrome reference field length; and  (c)   Thirdly:   Determine the code letter of element 2 corresponding to the dimensions of the aeroplane’s wing and outer main gear span. The code letter for element 2 is the code letter which corresponds to the wingspan, or the outer main gear span, whichever gives the most demanding code letter. For instance, if code letter C corresponds to the aeroplane’s wingspan and code letter D corresponds to the aeroplane’s outer main gear span, the code letter selected would be D for that aeroplane type.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 135   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   81   CAA of NZ  C.1.2   Determining the minimum runway width using Table 2  Having determined the aeroplane’s ARC, the runway widths are determined by entering at the applicable code number and then moving across to the value under the applicable code letter. For instance, if the aeroplane ARC is 2C, the required runway width is 30 m.  Table 2.

(b)   When calculating the landing weight under paragraph (a), a holder of an air operator certificate must take account of—

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 135   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   82   CAA of NZ  (1)   aerodrome elevation; and  (2)   ambient temperature at the aerodrome; and  (3)   the type of runway surface and the runway surface condition; and  (4)   the runway slope in the direction of landing; and  (5)   not more than 50% of the reported headwind component or not less than 150% of the reported tailwind component.  (c)   For an aeroplane to land as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b), it is assumed that the aeroplane will land on the most favourable runway taking into account—  (1)   the forecast meteorological conditions; and  (2)   surrounding terrain; and  (3)   approach and landing aids; and  (4)   obstacles within the missed approach flight path.  (d)   If the holder of an air operator certificate is unable to comply with paragraph (c) for the destination aerodrome, the aeroplane may be dispatched if   an   alternate   aerodrome   is   designated   that   permits   compliance   with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c).  D.2   Permitted landing distance assessments – Wet or contaminated runway  A holder of an air operator certificate must carry out the following procedure under rule 135.233(b)(2) for calculating the landing distance where a runway is wet   or contaminated –  ensure that, for each aeroplane it operates, when the relevant weather reports or forecasts or a combination of them, indicate that the runway at the estimated time of arrival of its aeroplane may be wet or contaminated, the landing distance available is at least 115% of the landing distance required by paragraph D.1.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 139   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   84   CAA of NZ  (b)   All mobile objects to be marked must be coloured or marked with display flags.  F.3   Use of markers  Markers displayed on or adjacent to objects must be located in conspicuous positions so as to retain the general definition of the object and must be recognizable in clear weather from a distance of at least 1000 m for an object to be viewed from the air and 300 m for an object to be viewed from the ground in all directions in which an aircraft is likely to approach the object. The shape of markers must be distinctive to the extent necessary to ensure that they are not mistaken for markers employed to convey other information, and they must be such that the hazard presented by the object they mark is not increased.  F.4   Use of flags  (a)   Flags used to mark objects must be displayed around, on top of, or around the highest edge of, the object. When flags are used to mark extensive objects or groups of closely spaced objects, they must be displayed at least every 15 m. Flags must not increase the hazard presented by the object they mark.  (b)   Flags used to mark fixed objects must not be less than 0.6 m square and flags used to mark mobile objects, not less than 0.9 m square.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 139   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   85   CAA of NZ  Appendix G — Visual Aids for Denoting Restricted Use Areas  G.1   Closed runways and taxiways  A closed marking must be displayed on a runway or taxiway, or portion thereof, which is permanently closed to the use of all aircraft.  G.2   Non-load-bearing surfaces  Shoulders for taxiways, holding bays and aprons and other non-load-bearing surfaces which cannot readily be distinguished from load-bearing surfaces and which, if used by aircraft, might result in damage to the aircraft must have the boundary between such areas and the load-bearing surface marked by a side stripe marking.  G.3   Unserviceable areas  Unserviceability markers must be displayed wherever any portion of a taxiway, apron or holding bay is unfit for the movement of aircraft but it is still possible for aircraft to bypass the area safely. On a movement area used at night, unserviceability lights must be used.  Appendix H — Electrical Systems  H.1   Power supply systems for air navigation facilities  (a)   Adequate primary power supply must be available at aerodromes for the safe functioning of air navigation facilities.  (b)   For aerodromes that are referred to in rule 139.5(aa)(1), the design and provision of electrical power systems for the aerodrome visual and radio navigation aids must be such that an equipment failure will not leave pilots with inadequate visual and non-visual guidance or misleading information.  H.2   Visual aids  (a)   For a precision approach runway, a secondary power supply capable of meeting the requirements specified in Table H-1 for the appropriate category of precision approach runway must be provided. Electric power supply connections to those facilities for which secondary power is required must be so arranged that the facilities are automatically connected to the secondary power supply on failure of the primary source of power.

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 139   CAA Consolidation  5 April 2025   86   CAA of NZ  (b)   For a runway meant for take-off in runway visual range conditions of less than 800 m, a secondary power supply capable of meeting the relevant requirements of Table H-1 must be provided.  H.3   System design  (a)   For a runway meant for use in runway visual range conditions of less than 550 m, the electrical systems for the power supply, lighting and control of the lighting systems included in Table H-1 must be so designed that an equipment failure will not leave the pilot with inadequate visual guidance or misleading information.  (b)   Where the secondary power supply of an aerodrome is provided by the use of duplicate feeders, such supplies must be physically and electrically separate so as to ensure the required level of availability and independence.  (c)   Where a runway forming part of a standard taxi-route is provided with runway   lighting   and   taxiway   lighting,   the   lighting   systems   must   be interlocked to preclude the possibility of simultaneous operation of both forms of lighting.  H.4   Monitoring  Where lighting systems are used for aircraft control purposes, such systems must be monitored automatically so as to provide an indication of any fault which   may   affect   the   control   functions.   This   information   must   be automatically relayed to the air traffic service unit.  Table H-1.

Published by the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand  Part 140  Providers of Aviation Security Services  5 April 2025  CAA Consolidation

Civil Aviation Rules   Part 140   CAA Consolidation  This document is the current consolidated version of Part 140 produced by the Civil Aviation Authority, and serves as a reference only.   It is compiled from the rules that have been signed into law by the Minister of Transport.   Copies of the rules as signed by the Minister of Transport may be obtained from the Civil Aviation Authority or may be downloaded from the official web site at: www.caa.govt.nz  5 April 2025   2   CAA of NZ  Rule Objective  The objective of Part 140 is to   set standards, specifications, restrictions, and requirements for the issue and exercise of an Aviation Security Service certificate under the Civil Aviation Act 2023, and to   fulfil New Zealand’s obligations under ICAO Annex 17 for organisations providing aviation security services:  •   at Tier 1 security designated aerodromes  •   at security designated navigation installations.  Part 140 prescribes requirements for the certification (entry standards), operation (continued operations), and safety audit (monitoring and evaluation) of persons providing aviation security services.  AvSec is not required to hold a certificate to provide aviation security services (see sections 134 and 136 of the Act), but is required to comply with all requirements imposed by these Rules on certificate holders, unless the Rules provide otherwise (see section 139). These Rules therefore specify which requirements apply to applicants and certificate holders do not apply to AvSec, and requirements that are different for AvSec.
